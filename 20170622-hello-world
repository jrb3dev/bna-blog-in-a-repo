# Hello, World!

First post in the experimental "blog in a repo".
(SFX: Hallelujah Chorus main theme, six-hundred-voice choir)

I like the idea of evolving myself and how I articulate my thoughts.
What better way to expose that evolution than to treat it as if it were code,
and lay it into version control?
Browse as you would for any code-base, to see the current state easily
yet examine the changes when you wish.

This doubles as a means of backing up some business-related documents
which I want to make visible for others to explore and play with.
