# Quarterly rhythms

Quarter contains six fortnights, with several loose days.
Loose days get piled up at start or end of quarter,
to form holidays around mid-summer and mid-winter.

Quarterly planning occurs on the first day of the quarter.
Quarterly review happens on the last day of the quarter.
For work groups, which meet only on work-days, these of course would be first and last *working* days.
Depending on how the loose days are distributed, these quarterly events might or might not hit within a sprint.
In such a conflict, the longer rhythm of the quarter brings its events to bump the sprint's event.
