# Yearly rhythms

Year contains four quarters.

Yearly planning occurs on the first day(s) of the year.
Yearly review happens on the last day(s) of the year.
For work groups, which meet only on work-days, these of course would be first and last *working* days.
These events will often conflict with quarterly events.
In such a conflict, the longer rhythm of the year brings its events to bump the quarter's events.
