## Why a business "on the side"
I find I'm pressed to grow more when facing skills I want to improve.
This "side hustle" lets me work on specific relevant non-technical skills.

My previous consulting firms failed for lack of effective marketing and sales.
I know I will shift back into this as my career winds down and the household transitions into post-work life.
Meantime, I want to try my hand at several different types of products and services,
to generate further funds for household investment and for philanthropy.
My daughters can also learn how to go about supporting themselves
during college and into their own adulthood.
