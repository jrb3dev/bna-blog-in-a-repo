# Fortnightly (sprintly?) rhythms

Fortnight/sprint contains 14 calendar days, normally encompassing 10 working days.

Sprint planning occurs on the first day of the sprint.
Sprint review happens on the last day of the sprint.
For work groups, which meet only on work-days, these of course would be first and last *working* days.
