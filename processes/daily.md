# Daily rhythms

Day contains several blocks of time, organized to best support making progress on worthwhile results.

Daily planning occurs early in the day.
Daily review happens late in the day.
Events of longer periods will occur within focused blocks of time during the day;
unlike at higher levels, events of longer cycles do not displace events of the daily cycle.
