# Rhythms of planning and doing

## Make use of varying levels of scale in time

Nature provides us daily and yearly rhythms through our bodies' responsiveness to solar cycles.
The natural world gives us differences in scale between levels somewhat around 3-10.
That suggests two or three rhythms to insert into the sequence.

Taylor Pearson, among others, argues that [90-day planning][1] is a great breakdown of yearly.
It even meshes well with the natural cycle of seasons.

Typically, we progress thereafter to months (3 per season), then weeks (4+ per month), then days (7 per week).
Weeks often seem too short, with months too long, for making substantial progress.

Putting one layer instead of two, we look to something akin to 9 sets of 9 days.
Using weeks directly (13 sets of 7 days, plus 1-2 extra) doesn't help,
especially considering working weeks of 5 days each.

Many Agile teams find a sweet spot in the fortnight (6 "sprints" of 14 days, plus 7-8 extra).
Quarterly breaks make sense, and give time for longer planning and reflection.
My own particular take is to shovel all the non-sprint days together,
forming summer and winter holidays of 2-3 weeks each.

## Make use of similarities across different levels of scale

For each level of scale, use similar patterns of behavior.
Start with planning appropriate to that scale, do, then review/retrospect to close the period.

## Shorter periods do not split across multiple longer periods

This is a continual annoyance when trying to work with weeks and months.
There's always a few extra days floating around, which means some months get five weekends,
or a third biweekly paycheck, or otherwise cause havoc with keeping the smaller cycles in tune with the larger cycles.

My own preference for quarters breaking down into fortnights and loose days solves this tension for me.

Generally speaking, when planning events of two or more scales compete for time to be performed,
the longer scale takes precedence, pushing shorter-scale planning later or shorter-scale review earlier.

## Plan no further than necessary

For each level of scale, work gets broken down just far enough to be sensible for the next level down.
This invites easy adaptability when some better idea for execution comes along,
or even a different opportunity (or threat) means the best course of action is to throw an item out.

For me, this also makes it easy to keep my planning sessions short and unafflicted by "analysis paralysis".
